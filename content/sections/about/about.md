Start the journey as a software developer more than ten years ago. I've collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use.

I'm a fast learner and interested in the entire technology spectrum. I saw the technologies changing over time that makes me more excited because we as a humanity have betters way to solve the problems.

So, I define myself by the work I want to do, not what I've done. I believe in long-life learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.

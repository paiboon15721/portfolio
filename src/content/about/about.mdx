Start the journey as a <Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>software developer nearly ten years ago.</Underlining> I've collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use.

I'm a <Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>fast learner</Underlining> and interested in the entire technology spectrum. I saw the technologies changing over time that makes me more excited because we as a humanity have betters way to solve the problems.

So, I define myself by the work I want to do, not what I've done. I believe in <Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>long-life learning</Underlining>, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
